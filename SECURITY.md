# Security Implementation

## Queue System Security

### Recent Security Enhancements (Phase 1 - Completed)

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ **All job endpoints now require authentication** via better-auth session validation
- ✅ **User isolation**: Users can only see/modify their own jobs
- ✅ **Job ownership**: Every job is associated with a userId
- ✅ **Permission checks**: All operations verify ownership before execution

#### 2. Input Validation & Rate Limiting
- ✅ **Job data validation**: 
  - Maximum job data size: 256KB
  - Maximum delay: 30 days
  - Priority range: 0-100
- ✅ **Rate limiting**:
  - General API: 100 requests/minute
  - Auth endpoints: 5 requests/15 minutes
  - Job operations: 10 requests/minute per user
- ✅ **Pagination limits**: Maximum 100 items per page

#### 3. Redis Security
- ✅ **Password protection**: Redis now requires authentication
- ✅ **Connection strings**: Updated to include authentication

### Security Configuration

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Redis Security (change in production!)
REDIS_PASSWORD=your-secure-password-here
REDIS_URL=redis://:your-secure-password-here@redis:6379

# Authentication
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=min-32-char-secret-key-change-in-production
```

#### Docker Security
- Redis configured with password authentication
- Health checks use authenticated connections
- Network isolation between services

### Remaining Security Tasks (Phase 2-3)

#### High Priority
- [ ] Implement TLS/SSL for Redis connections (rediss://)
- [ ] Add field-level encryption for sensitive job data
- [ ] Implement job count quotas per user
- [ ] Add audit logging for all job operations

#### Medium Priority  
- [ ] Worker sandboxing and resource limits
- [ ] Memory limits per job execution
- [ ] Job execution timeouts
- [ ] Security event monitoring and alerting

#### Low Priority
- [ ] Admin role for system-wide job management
- [ ] CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- [ ] Request signing for sensitive operations

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never expose Redis ports** publicly (6379)
2. **Always use strong passwords** in production
3. **Rotate secrets regularly** 
4. **Monitor failed authentication attempts**
5. **Review job data** for sensitive information before storage
6. **Implement backup** and disaster recovery procedures

### Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to your security team
3. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. Allow time for patching before public disclosure

### Compliance Status
